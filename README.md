This is a repo which has materials, notes and codes to starting coding. Right now there is only Python here. In time, I plan to add Java, C/C++, Javascript and Hashscript. 

To use these materials, I recommend first reading the pdf's added about the topic. Then, trying to solve the problems given on the first lines of the codes and programs included. After completing the tasks, opening the code and reading it. After, I urge you to visit the pages tagged and try to solve them. When all is done, and if you think you understood the topic, you may proceed to the next packet. 

A few recommendations:
  1) Don't continue without understanding. 
  2) Don't be shy to use Google.
  3) Don't be afraid to ask help or questions.

I hope this will be helpful. For any ideas, feedbacks or questions, you may contact me from my twitter(@idyllacy) or email(idil.can@outlook.com.tr).
